Build Swift Apps is a multi-agent skill pack for practical Apple-platform
development. It focuses on the workflows that usually decide whether an AI
coding session is useful in a real Swift repository: building the app, running
it on a simulator, understanding failures, improving SwiftUI and AppKit code,
profiling performance, auditing Xcode build times, and preparing apps for
release.

The deepest coverage is for iOS and macOS, but the skills are written for
Apple-platform Swift work in general. They are intentionally generic: no
private project names, no private workflows, and no assumptions about
one app architecture.

## Quick Start

### Easiest: Ask Your Agent

For most users, the simplest install path is to paste this prompt into the
coding agent they already use:

```text
Install the Build Swift Apps plugin from https://github.com/Xopoko/build-swift-apps on this computer. Follow the repository installation instructions for the agent you are running in, install required dependencies, ask before installing optional tools, run the doctor checks, and report what was installed.
```

### Codex

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/plugins/plugins"
git clone https://github.com/Xopoko/build-swift-apps.git \
  "$HOME/.agents/plugins/plugins/build-swift-apps"
cd "$HOME/.agents/plugins/plugins/build-swift-apps"

./scripts/install-local-plugin.sh
./scripts/doctor.sh --profile core --profile mcp
```

Then start a new Codex thread and ask for a focused workflow:

> Use the iOS debugger skill to build and run this app on a simulator, inspect the first screen, and summarize any runtime failures.

### Claude Code

This repository includes Claude Code plugin metadata under `.claude-plugin/`.
After the repository is public or accessible to your GitHub account:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Xopoko/build-swift-apps
/plugin install build-swift-apps@build-swift-apps
/reload-plugins
```

If you use the `appstore-screenshot-studio` skill in Claude Code, install its local Node helper
dependency after the plugin is installed:

```bash
cd "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/build-swift-apps"
./scripts/install-deps.sh --profile screenshots --yes
```

Claude Code namespaces plugin skills, so invoke them as
`/build-swift-apps:<skill-name>` when calling skills explicitly.

### Cursor

This repository includes Cursor plugin metadata under `.cursor-plugin/`.
Use Cursor's plugin install or local testing flow once the repository is
available to your Cursor workspace. The same `skills/` directory is packaged for
Cursor, and `AGENTS.md` provides repository-level guidance for agents that read
the open instruction format.

### Dependency Check

The skills can run with partial dependencies. Check the current machine first:

```bash
./scripts/doctor.sh --all
```

Install only the tool groups you need:

```bash
./scripts/install-deps.sh --profile core --profile mcp
./scripts/install-deps.sh --profile tuist --profile performance --dry-run
./scripts/install-deps.sh --all --skip ettrace --skip ipsw
```

See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for full install instructions,
dependency profiles, and manual setup notes.

## Token Efficiency

Build Swift Apps is designed to keep startup context small. In Codex-style skill
loading, the agent starts with lightweight skill metadata: the skill name,
description, and file pointer. The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded only when that
skill is selected for the current task.

These estimates are generated with `scripts/token-report.py` using `tiktoken`
and the `o200k_base` encoding. Different agents may format metadata slightly
differently, but the split is the important part: small always-visible routing
metadata, larger instructions on demand.

| Metric | Tokens | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Startup metadata | 4,194 | Name, description, and file pointer for all 61 skills. |
| On-demand skill bodies | 38,587 | Full body text loaded only when a skill is selected. |

## Included Skills

The skill IDs follow a deliberate naming system:

- `app-icon-studio` for cross-platform Apple app icon generation and export.
- `appstore-*` for App Store Connect, TestFlight, screenshots, metadata, pricing, and release operations.
- `ios-*` and `macos-*` for platform-specific runtime, UI, packaging, and debugging work.
- `swiftui-*`, `xcode-*`, `swiftpm-*`, `tuist-*`, and `apple-*` for framework, build, package, project-generation, and research workflows.
- Role nouns describe the agent's posture: `architect`, `inspector`, `strategist`, `tuner`, `director`, `studio`, `operator`, `coordinator`, and `runner`.

## Multi-Agent Packaging

The same repository is packaged for several agent ecosystems:

| Agent/tool | Files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, `agents/openai.yaml`, `skills/*/agents/openai.yaml` | Native Codex plugin metadata, MCP server definitions, and OpenAI agent manifests. |
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Claude Code plugin and marketplace metadata. Skills live at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`. |
| Cursor | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | Cursor plugin metadata with the same skill directory list. |
| pi | `package.json` | `pi.skills` points at every packaged skill. |
| Generic agents | `AGENTS.md` | Repository-level instructions for agents that support the open `AGENTS.md` convention. |

## Host Dependencies

The plugin does not hide host requirements. Skills that need external tools
preflight them and fail clearly when missing. Dependency profiles are:

| Profile | Main tools |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Xcode, Swift, `xcodebuild`, `xcrun`, `git`, `python3`, signing and plist tools. |
| `mcp` | Node.js, `npm`, and `npx` for bundled MCP servers and browser-preview helpers. |
| `github` | `gh` for GitHub-oriented publishing and issue or PR workflows. |
| `tuist` | `mise` and `tuist@latest`. |
| `app-store` | `asc`, `notarytool`, `stapler`, signing tools, and App Store Connect credentials. |
| `screenshots` | AXe (`axe`) for `asc screenshots capture/run`, plus Node.js and the bundled `appstore-screenshot-studio` script dependency: `sharp`. |
| `performance` | `ettrace`, Xcode tools, Python helper scripts, and dSYM utilities. |
| `firmware` | `ipsw`. |
| `simulator` | RocketSim.app with its bundled Agent Skill and CLI, plus Node/npx for `serve-sim` browser mirroring. |

## Quality Bar

- Evidence first: build, run, test, profile, or inspect before making broad claims.
- Recommend-first for risky build and project changes: benchmark, plan, approve, then fix.
- Scoped edits: prefer the local project's patterns over generic rewrites.
- No private/internal workflows: this repository is meant to be reusable by any Apple-platform developer.
- Cross-agent compatibility: when a skill is added, update Codex, Claude, Cursor, pi, README, and `AGENTS.md` surfaces together.

## Validation

```bash
./scripts/validate-package.sh
./scripts/doctor.sh --all
```

`validate-package.sh` checks JSON manifests, script syntax, skill frontmatter,
multi-agent manifest coverage, and accidental private/work-specific terms.
